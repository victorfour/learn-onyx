;; In this challenge, we're going to log every segment that
;; we see after it's processed by the :times-three task with
;; the lifecycle hook :after-batch. We can obtain a reference
;; to the segments through the event map. The event map contains
;; lots of useful values pertaining to the currently running task.
;; We can access the segments by first looking at the :onyx.core/batch
;; key. This value is itself a sequence of Clojure Records. The Records,
;; which can uniformly be treated as maps in Clojure, have a key :message
;; on each them. We use a Record to increase performance - but that's
;; mostly a side-tangent and is unimportant to accomplishing the exercise.
;; Iterate over each segment with `doseq` to print out the segment's value.
;; The segments under the :onyx.core/batch key are the segment values *before*
;; the :onyx/fn function transforms them.
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-4-1-test`
