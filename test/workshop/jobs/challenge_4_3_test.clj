;; Time to compose what we've learned about state and lifecycles
;; with function parameters. One way is by using lifecycles, as
;; we have seen. The other is to add parameters to a function
;; with :onyx/params.
;;
;; You can add non-serializable parameters to a function by using the
;; :before-task-start and/or :before-batch lifecycles. Return a map
;; with key :onyx.core/params. The value of this key should be a vector
;; of values. This vector is applied to the *beginning* of the function
;; signature, so you'll get them before the segment.
;;
;; In this challenge, you'll create an atom using lifecycles to sum
;; up the :n values of a segment. Maintain the state through the function,
;; and access the atom as a parameter of the sum! function.
;;
;; This technique composes with all the other ways to inject parameters.
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-4-3-test`
