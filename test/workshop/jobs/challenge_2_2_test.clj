;; These functions and catalog entries that we're writing
;; are getting pretty specific. Can we write generic versions
;; of these catalog entries and supply parameters at runtime? Yes!
;;
;; Now we're going to build on the previous challenge and implement
;; the same job, except we'll use generic "plus" and "times" catalog entries.
;; There are a few ways that you can supply parameters to a function, but
;; the most direct for supplying Clojure values is a catalog parameter called
;; :onyx/params. :onyx/params takes a vector of keywords. These keywords are
;; looked up inside the same catalog entry and resolved to values. Parameters
;; are appended to the *front* of the function signature - the segment always
;; comes last.
;;
;; An example, partial catalog entry that takes parameters looks like:
;;
;; {:onyx/name :my-task-name
;;  :onyx/fn :my.ns/fn
;;  :onyx/type :function
;;  :my/param "this is argument" ; actual value we'll pass for the argument identified by :my/param
;;  :onyx/params [:my/param]}    ; vector of keywords to fill in as parameters
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-2-2-test
