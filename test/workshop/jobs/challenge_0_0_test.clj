;; This is a basic, already-complete example to test that Onyx is working
;; okay on your machine. Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-0-0-test`
;;
;; You should see some output printed to standard out.
;; If this is your first time using Onyx, look at the corresponding
;; source file to get a feel of the parts of an Onyx program.
