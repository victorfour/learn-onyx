;; In this level, we're going to explore the catalog data structure.
;; Catalogs describe what the tasks of a workflow actually do, and
;; how to parameterize them in a functional and non-functional manner.
;;
;; This challenge is an already-working example to get you started.
;; It takes a stream of numbers and multiplies them by 2.
;; Go to the source file and read the comments about the catalog to get
;; an explanation about how it works.
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-2-0-test`
