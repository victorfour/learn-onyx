;; Our next topic to tackle will be lifecycles. Lifecycles are a
;; feature that allow you to control code that executes at particular
;; points during task execution on each peer. Lifecycles are data driven
;; and composable.
;;
;; Lifecycles are great for building up state, executing side effects like
;; logging, and talking to metrics servers. They also allow you to inject
;; non-serializable parameters, such as database connections, into functions.
;;
;; Onyx has an entire chapter in the user guide dedicated to lifecycles:
;; http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/user-guide/latest/#lifecycles
;;
;; This challenge is an already-working example. Explore the lifecycles
;; and comments in the corresponding source file about the contracts
;; that Onyx lifecycles must abide by.
;;
;; Try it with:
;;
;; `lein test workshop.jobs.challenge-4-0-test`
