;; One of the major problems that we haven't tackled yet are
;; fault tolerant, stateful streaming computations. Previously,
;; we used in-memory atoms to count values and maintain general
;; aggregates over a stream of data. This works well enough for some
;; uses cases, but it has its limitations.

;; To achieve fault tolerance, Onyx will replay segments from the root
;; input task of which it was emitted if the segment failed to complete
;; within a configurable duration (the default is 60 seconds). It could be
;; the case that segments successfully make it through some of your stateful
;; tasks, only to fail later in the workflow. The segments would then pass
;; through your stateful tasks again. Even if Onyx didn't use this specific
;; technique for fault tolerance, this would be still be problematic because
;; it is provably impossible to execute a distributed instruction exactly once -
;; see the Two Generals problem for why this is the case.

;; Clearly, many computations need to have perfectly correct aggregate answers,
;; even in the face of machine failure. We tackled this problem in Onyx and
;; made a set of first class features to support it. These features are Windows,
;; Triggers, and Refinement Modes. While the idea of windowing is relatively
;; straightforward, the number of combinations between how each of these pieces
;; can be put together merits a close read of the documentation.

;; You can read about Windowing at:
;; http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/user-guide/latest/#windowing-and-aggregation

;; After you've read about Windowing, it's important to understand Triggers:
;; http://www.onyxplatform.org/docs/user-guide/latest/#triggers

;; You'll notice that in this example, we use more stateful constructs like
;; atoms and promises. Some of this is used to coordinate knowledge of
;; completion. We'll explain what we're doing in each step for this challenge,
;; since we understand that it increases the level of complexity as a learner.
;; If you get stuck reading any particular part, keep moving. You might see
;; something further down the source or test file that helps you understand
;; what's going on.

;;
;; This challenge is an already-working example of Fixed windowing. We recommend
;; reading the entirety of the source code for this example - there are more
;; moving parts than before.
