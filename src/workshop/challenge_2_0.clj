;;; <<< BEGIN READ ME >>>

;; Catalogs describe what tasks actually do and wire them up
;; to their concrete Clojure implementations. Here, we define
;; a function that returns a catalog. It takes two possible
;; parameters - batch-size and batch-timeout. These are both
;; throughput and latency tuning knobs.
;;
;; There are three "types" of catalog entries:
;; :input, :function, and :output. These are denoted by
;; :onyx/type.

      ;; type. :input and :output catalog entries talk to plugins.
      ;; Plugins are the mechanism by which data is moved in and out of
      ;; Onyx. The important thing to note here is :onyx/plugin.
      ;; This is mapped to a predefined keyword (resolved to a fn in that namespace) 
      ;; by the plugin author. You'd typically find this
      ;; catalog entry in the README of the plugin repository.
